# Desired Ocupation : **Data Scientist**

# *I am interested in data science because,data is the heart of any organisation. 10 to 15 years ago, we did not have this much of data that we are generating today.
# The decission I make is always data driven and I always try to visualize the data so that I can make my decission clearly.
# Moreover I can say crunching numbers, finding patterns in data, visualizing data and story telling,building,testing and deployiing ML models is a lot interesting and cchallenging.
# Due to above said reason and a person who loves challenges,would love to be a data scientist.*
